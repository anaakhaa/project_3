An RFID-based bus monitoring system using a Flask app is a way to keep track of buses and passengers automatically. RFID tags are used to log when passengers get on or off the bus, and the bus's location is tracked in real-time. This information is displayed in a simple web app built with Flask, allowing people to easily check where the bus is and who is on it. The system makes bus travel safer and more efficient by providing real-time updates and easy access to important information.
